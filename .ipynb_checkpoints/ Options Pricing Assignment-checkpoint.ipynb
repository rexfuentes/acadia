    "\n",
    "The Black-Scholes-Merton model is used for pricing European call and put options. It assumes a geometric Brownian motion for the underlying asset price, incorporating factors like the asset's current price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and volatility. The provided functions, `black_scholes_call` and `black_scholes_put`, calculate the prices of European call and put options, respectively.\n"
